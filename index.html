                <p>Five years have past; five summers, with the length</p>
                <p>Of five long winters! and again I hear </p>
                <p>These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs</p> 
                <p>With a soft inland murmur.—Once again </p> 
                <p>Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs, </p> 
                <p>That on a wild secluded scene impress </p> 
                <p>Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect </p> 
                <p>The landscape with the quiet of the sky.</p>  
                <p>The day is come when I again repose </p>

            <div class="intro">
                <p>Here, under this dark sycamore, and view </p> 
                <p>These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts, </p> 
                <p>Which at this season, with their unripe fruits, </p> 
                <p>Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves </p> 
                <p>'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see </p> 
                <p>These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines </p> 
                <p>Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms, </p> 
                <p>Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke </p> 
                <p>Sent up, in silence, from among the trees! </p> 
                <p>With some uncertain notice, as might seem </p> 
                <p>Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,</p>  
                <p>Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire </p> 
                <p>The Hermit sits alone. </p>

                <p>These beauteous forms, </p>
                <p>Through a long absence, have not been to me </p>
                <p>As is a landscape to a blind man's eye: </p>
                <p>But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din </p>
                <p>Of towns and cities, I have owed to them, </p>
                <p>In hours of weariness, sensations sweet, </p>
                <p>Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart; </p>
                <p>And passing even into my purer mind </p>

                <p>With tranquil restoration:—feelings too </p>
                <p>Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps, </p>
                <p>As have no slight or trivial influence </p>
                <p>On that best portion of a good man's life, </p>
                <p>His little, nameless, unremembered, acts </p>
                <p>Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust, </p>
                <p>To them I may have owed another gift, </p>
                <p>Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood, </p>
                <p>In which the burthen of the mystery, </p>
                <p>In which the heavy and the weary weight </p>
                <p>Of all this unintelligible world, </p>
                <p>Is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood, </p>
                <p>In which the affections gently lead us on,— </p>
                <p>Until, the breath of this corporeal frame </p>
                <p>And even the motion of our human blood </p>
                <p>Almost suspended, we are laid asleep </p>
                <p>In body, and become a living soul: </p>
                <p>While with an eye made quiet by the power </p>
                <p>Of harmony, and the deep power of joy, </p>
                <p>We see into the life of things. </p>

                <p>In darkness and amid the many shapes </p>
                <p>Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir </p>
                <p>Unprofitable, and the fever of the world, </p>
                <p>Have hung upon the beatings of my heart— </p>
                <p>How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee, </p>
                <p>O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods, </p>

                <p>With many recognitions dim and faint, </p>
                <p>And somewhat of a sad perplexity, </p>
                <p>The picture of the mind revives again: </p>
                <p>While here I stand, not only with the sense </p>
                <p>Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts </p>
                <p>That in this moment there is life and food </p>
                <p>For future years. And so I dare to hope, </p>
                <p>Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first </p>
                <p>I came among these hills; when like a roe </p>
                <p>I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides </p>
                <p>Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams, </p>
                <p>Wherever nature led: more like a man </p>
                <p>Flying from something that he dreads, than one </p>
                <p>Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then </p>
                <p>(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days </p>
                <p>And their glad animal movements all gone by) </p>
                <p>To me was all in all.—I cannot paint </p>
                <p>What then I was.

                <p> The sounding cataract </p>
                <p>Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock, </p>
                <p>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, </p>
                <p>Their colours and their forms, were then to me </p>
                <p>An appetite; a feeling and a love, </p>
                <p>That had no need of a remoter charm, </p>
                <p>By thought supplied, not any interest </p>
                <p>Unborrowed from the eye.—That time is past, </p>
                <p>And all its aching joys are now no more, </p>
                <p>And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this </p>
                <p>Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts </p>
                <p>Have followed; for such loss, I would believe, </p>
                <p>Abundant recompense. For I have learned </p>
                <p>To look on nature, not as in the hour </p>
                <p>Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes </p>
                <p>The still sad music of humanity, </p>
                <p>Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power </p>
                <p>To chasten and subdue.

                <p>A presence that disturbs me with the joy </p>
                <p>Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime </p>
                <p>Of something far more deeply interfused, </p>
                <p>Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, </p>
                <p>And the round ocean and the living air, </p>

                <p>And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still </p>
                <p>A lover of the meadows and the woods </p>
                <p>And mountains; and of all that we behold </p>

                <p>Of eye, and ear,—both what they half create, </p>
                <p>And what perceive; well pleased to recognise </p>
                <p>In nature and the language of the sense </p>
                <p>The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse, </p>
